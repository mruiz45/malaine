# Implementation and Validation for User Story 2: Dynamic Internationalization (i18n)

This document outlines the changes made to implement dynamic language switching and provides steps to validate the functionality.

## Implemented Changes

1.  **Installed Libraries**: Added `react-i18next`, `i18next`, `i18next-browser-languagedetector`, and `i18next-resources-to-backend` to handle internationalization.
2.  **i18n Configuration**: Created `lib/i18n.ts` to configure the i18n behavior, including language detection and loading of translation files.
3.  **Translation Files**: Added JSON translation files for English and French in `public/locales/`.
4.  **Language Switcher**: Created a new `components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx` component that allows users to switch between "EN" and "FR".
5.  **Application Integration**:
    *   Updated `app/layout.tsx` to include an i18n provider.
    *   Added the `LanguageSwitcher` to `components/Header.tsx`.
    *   Converted `components/Header.tsx` and `app/page.tsx` to Client Components to use i18n hooks.
6.  **Content Translation**: Replaced hardcoded text for the welcome message and navigation links with keys from the translation files.

## How to Validate

To validate the implementation, please follow these steps:

1.  **Run the Application**: Make sure the development server is running (`npm run dev`).
2.  **Check Default Language (AC1)**:
    *   Open the application in your browser.
    *   Verify that all text (header navigation, welcome message) is displayed in **English** by default.
3.  **Switch Language to French (AC2, AC3)**:
    *   In the header, you will see a language switcher (`EN / FR`).
    *   Click on **"FR"**.
    *   Verify that all UI text instantly updates to **French** without a full page reload. The welcome message should be "Bienvenue sur Malaine â€“ votre assistant tricot/crochet" and the navigation links should be "Accueil" and "Projets".
4.  **Verify Language Persistence (AC4)**:
    *   With the language set to French, **refresh the page**.
    *   Verify that the page reloads with **French** as the selected language. This confirms the language preference is persisted in a cookie.
5.  **Switch Back to English**:
    *   Click on **"EN"** in the language switcher.
    *   Verify that the UI text switches back to **English** instantly.

Following these steps will confirm that all acceptance criteria for User Story 2 have been met.
