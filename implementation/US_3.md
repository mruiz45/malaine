# Implementation Report: User Story 3 - User Authentication

This document details the work completed for User Story 3 and provides instructions for testing and validating the new authentication features.

## Summary of Changes

- **Dependencies Added:**
  - `@supabase/ssr`: The new, recommended library for Supabase SSR and App Router integration.
  - `@supabase/supabase-js`: Core Supabase JavaScript client.

- **Configuration:**
  - **Environment:** The `.env.local` file now requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
  - **Supabase Clients:** Created modular clients using `@supabase/ssr` in `lib/supabase/` for browser, server, and middleware contexts.
  - **Middleware:** Implemented `middleware.ts` to manage session cookies and enforce route protection across the application.

- **New Pages & Components:**
  - `app/login/page.tsx`: A new page for user login.
  - `app/signup/page.tsx`: A new page for user signup.
  - `app/dashboard/page.tsx`: A new protected page for authenticated users.
  - `components/auth/LogoutButton.tsx`: A reusable client component for the logout functionality.

- **Authentication Logic (Server Actions):**
  - `app/login/actions.ts`: Handles the sign-in logic.
  - `app/signup/actions.ts`: Handles the new user registration logic.
  - `app/dashboard/actions.ts`: Handles the sign-out logic.

- **Internationalization:**
  - All user-facing text for the new features has been added to `public/locales/en/translation.json`.

## How to Test & Validate

To validate the implementation, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Supabase Project:** Ensure you have a Supabase project created.
2.  **Enable Authentication:** In your Supabase project dashboard, go to **Authentication -> Providers** and ensure **Email** is enabled. Disable "Confirm email" for now to match the current implementation (email confirmation can be added later).
3.  **Update Environment File:** Make sure your `.env.local` file contains the correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from your Supabase project's API settings.

### Test Cases

**AC1: New User Signup**
1.  Navigate to the `/signup` page.
2.  Fill in the form with a new email and a password. Ensure the confirmation password matches.
3.  Click the "Create account" button.
4.  **Expected Result:** You should be redirected to the `/dashboard` page.
5.  **Validation:** Check the `auth.users` table in your Supabase project dashboard. The new user account should be present.

**AC2: Existing User Login**
1.  Log out if you are currently logged in. You should be redirected to `/login`.
2.  Navigate to the `/login` page.
3.  Enter the credentials of the user you just created.
4.  Click the "Log in" button.
5.  **Expected Result:** You should be successfully logged in and redirected to the `/dashboard` page.

**AC3: Incorrect Login**
1.  Go to the `/login` page.
2.  Enter a correct email but an incorrect password.
3.  Click "Log in".
4.  **Expected Result:** The page should reload and display the "Invalid login credentials" error message. The message should be in English, sourced from the i18n file.

**AC4: Logout**
1.  While logged in, navigate to the `/dashboard` page.
2.  Click the "Logout" button.
3.  **Expected Result:** Your session should be terminated, and you should be redirected to the `/login` page.

**AC5: Protected Route Access**
1.  Ensure you are logged out.
2.  Attempt to navigate directly to `/dashboard`.
3.  **Expected Result:** You should be automatically redirected to the `/login` page.

**AC6: Redirect Authenticated Users**
1.  Ensure you are logged in and on the `/dashboard` page.
2.  In the same browser tab, try to navigate directly to `/login`.
3.  **Expected Result:** You should be automatically redirected back to `/dashboard`.
4.  Repeat the process for the `/signup` page. You should also be redirected to `/dashboard`.

**AC7: Environment Variables**
1.  **Validation:** Inspect the client-side source code in your browser's developer tools. Verify that the Supabase URL and anon key are not hardcoded and are being properly accessed via environment variables (they should not be visible).
